# DailyTaskManager 
In this project, I have developed a Daily Task Manager program using the Java programming language. The program allows users to manage their daily task list with various features such as adding, deleting, updating, and marking tasks as completed. The program uses Array, Linked List, and Stack data structures to manage the task list efficiently.

## Challenges Faced in Java Error Handling
- Null Pointer Exception: When trying to access an element in an empty Linked List, the program crashed. I solved it by adding validation before accessing the node.
- Array Index Out of Bounds: When the user entered an invalid task index in the array, an error occurred. I handled this by validating the user input before processing the data.
- Understanding Stack for Undo Feature: Implementing the Undo Completed Task feature using Stack requires an understanding of Last In, First Out (LIFO) to restore completed tasks.

## Key Features of the program
- User-Friendly Menu: The program provides a main menu with two task management options using Array and Linked List.
- Colorful Console Output: Uses ANSI escape codes to give color to the text, making the program look more attractive.
- Interactive and Fun Interface: Each action is given a notification message with emoji to enhance the user experience.

## Lessons Learned
This project helped me understand various aspects of Java programming, including:
- Data Structure Usage: Implementation of Array, Linked List, and Stack in data management.
- User Input Validation: Preventing errors by checking input before processing.
- String Manipulation in Java: Understanding the difference between == and .equals() in comparing strings.
- Color Implementation in Console Output: Using ANSI escape codes to give color to text, improving user experience.

By completing this project, I gained a better understanding of how Java can be used to create applications that are interactive and efficient in managing daily tasks.
